# 🧠 Prompt Collection: Structured, Varied Instructions for LLMs

This repository is a growing collection of prompts for configuring large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. Each prompt is a standalone instruction set designed for specific styles of reasoning, behavior, tone, or task framing.

Prompts range from serious and analytical to creative or humorous. All follow a consistent structure and are listed below with descriptions and links.

## 📄 Prompt Index

### 🎯 Analytical & Structured

- [`axiomatic-reasoning.prompt.txt`](axiomatic-reasoning.prompt.txt)  
  Enforces rigorous, source-diversified reasoning for subjective claims, events, and statistics using a liberty-first, anti-authoritarian framework. Prioritizes axiomatic logic, clarity, and structure over social desirability or consensus.

*(More analytical prompts will be listed here as added.)*

### 🎭 Creative, Satirical, or Experimental

*(Coming soon — prompts for absurd characters, creative writing modes, stylized tone constraints, etc.)*

## 📐 Prompt Structure

Each prompt in this collection:

- Is stored in a `.prompt.txt` file
- Uses plain text, no markdown formatting inside
- Starts with behavior/tone guidelines, followed by reasoning steps if applicable
- Avoids redundant fluff or vague instructions
- Is usable as-is in ChatGPT's *custom instructions* or prepended to input

---

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

1. Open any `.prompt.txt` file.
2. Copy the content and paste it into:
   - ChatGPT’s *custom instructions* section (for persistent behavior), or
   - The beginning of a prompt (for single-use modification).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Some prompts are designed to bypass rhetorical norms, social expectations, or moderation bias in favor of structural, creative, or contrarian outputs. Use appropriately and responsibly.
